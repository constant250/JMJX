The tasks in this test are adapted from tasks bank developed by Precision Group in collaboration with Commonwealth of Australia.</p>
                <p class="px-12-font no-margin">The assessment tasks align with the Australian Core Skills Framework (ACSF). The ACSF is a national framework that provides:</p>

This individual assessment can then be compared with the LLN levels required of a training program (or unit or qualification), or workplace tasks. The person may be a new entrant to the training sector, or may be following a training pathway to a new course or qualification.</p>
                <p class="px-12-font no-margin">The purpose of the assessment should be to determine whether the person:</p>
                <ul class="crm-form-list px-12-font">
                  <li>should complete an LLN bridging program before commencing the training, or</li>

                <p class="px-12-font">Identified gaps can be addressed in various ways, for example bridging courses, specialist LLN practitioner support, or activities provided by a vocational trainer with knowledge of developing LLN skills.</p>

                  <h4 class="iris-blue-font-color px-12-font"><b>Step 1: The assessment interview</b></h4>

                  <p class="px-12-font">The assessment process should begin with an interview with the candidate. Use the PART A of test to guide the interview.</p>
                  <p class="px-12-font">The assessor should put the candidate at ease and explain that the purpose of the LLN test interview is to gather information about their educational background and LLN skill level to help determine future training support needs. They should also explain that the assessment will include a one-to-one chat and then some time will be given for the candidate to complete tasks of PART B. Assessors should encourage candidates to feel comfortable and ask questions at any time.</p>
                  <p class="px-12-font">The interview is an opportunity for the assessor to gather information about the candidate’s oral communication and learning skills. Assessors can also start thinking about which tasks may be appropriate, depending on the candidate’s background, interest areas and future training goals.</p>

                  <p class="px-12-font">PART A should be completed by the assessor in conversation with the candidate. Not all questions will be relevant. The form includes prompts for the assessor to flesh out questions where appropriate, but they could also use their own prompts.</p>
                  <p class="px-12-font">The self-reflection (included in PART A) is also designed to be completed through interview. It is a task to encourage candidates to talk about the skills they have and the skills they would like to develop. </p>
                  <p class="px-12-font no-margin">Because they are conducted orally, the assessment interview and the self-assessment are ways of specifically collecting information about the candidate’s oral communication skills.</p>
                  <p class="px-12-font">Ideally, an assessment interview would be conducted in a quiet place on a one-to-one basis</p>

                  <h4 class="iris-blue-font-color px-12-font"><b>Step 2: PART B Assessment tasks</b></h4>
                  
                  <p class="px-12-font">There are two assessment tasks in PART B. These are useful to get an idea of the candidate’s skill level. The tasks can provide valuable information about the candidate’s ability to cope with specific skills and language relevant to particular training.</p>
                  <p class="px-12-font">Remember to consider the support, context, text and task complexity factors when selecting the tasks. For example, a level 3 task given with a high level of support will deem the task level 2 in many cases.</p>

                  <p class="px-12-font">There are two assessment tasks in PART B. These are useful to get an idea of the candidate’s skill level. The tasks can provide valuable information about the candidate’s ability to cope with specific skills and language relevant to particular training.</p>

                  <h4 class="iris-blue-font-color px-12-font"><b>Step 4: Make the assessment judgement</b></h4>

                  <p class="px-12-font no-margin">Based on your knowledge of the ACSF skill levels, make a judgement about the candidate’s skill level.</p>
                  <p class="px-12-font">When making the judgement, remember to consider the support provided, the context, the task and the task complexity. For example, the candidate may have completed an ACSF level 3 task, but was only able to do it with support. The assessor will need to make a decision about whether this candidate is perhaps only performing at ACSF level 2 or lower. If the candidate’s performance indicates that they are not operating at the required ACSF level to complete the training successfully it might be necessary to recommend LLN support prior to, or during the training.</p>

                  <h4 class="iris-blue-font-color px-12-font"><b>Step 5: Communicate the assessment decision to the candidate</b></h4>

                  <p class="px-12-font">It is good practice to ensure that candidates understand more about their LLN skill levels, having undertaken the assessment. Explain the results of the assessment to the candidate, what the levels mean, and how they may impact on and training that the candidate may undertake. Answer any questions that candidates may have.</p>
